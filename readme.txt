== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This plug-in does not seem to do anything? =

On it's own, you are correct. 
This plug-in houses commonly used framework and functionality for the other plug-ins & themes created in the WP Themers WordPress offering. They cannot work without this plug-in.

= Where are these other plug-ins? =

We're releasing them to the WordPress repository at the quickest rate we can; but virtually all of our code was written for clients who required a non-GLPv2 compatible licence. There may be a small window where the framework is availible prior to the other plug-ins.
